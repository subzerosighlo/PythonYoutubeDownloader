To use this python script, you will need pytube module installed.

to install pytube
pip3 install pytube

once that is installed then you can run python3 yt.py, it will ask for a youtube video link, then it will show title of video
then it will ask where you want to download video, you have to give the full path ie: "/Users/Username/Desktop/" or
if you use OneDrive it would look like something like this: "/Users/Username/OneDrive/Desktop/"
then it will download video and it is set to get the highest res of video.
